# ai-site-generator

This project is a Python script designed to generate a visually appealing and responsive portfolio website for a given GitHub user. The script utilizes OpenAI's API to generate the HTML content, which is then deployed to Vercel, a popular platform for hosting static websites. The script fetches the user's information from the GitHub API, and the resulting portfolio website highlights the user's profile details in a well-organized and mobile-friendly layout.
